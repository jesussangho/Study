        <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
        dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside
        <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the three core technologies
        of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs,
        including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the
        need for plug-ins by means of a built-in <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine. Each of the many <span
            class="js">JavaScript</span> engines represent a different implementation of <span
            class="js">JavaScript</span>, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting
        the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
