                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web
                browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web
                developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark
                up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make
                content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider
                the following line of text:
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
